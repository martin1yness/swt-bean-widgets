-- README :: SWT-BEAN-WIDGETS
--
-- This library is a set experimental widgets intended to be used with
-- bean like Java business applications. They have all been built for 
-- a singluar data management system and may not be adaptable to your
-- projects. With that said, I would love to make them more generic and
-- useful to others and will try to do so as time permits.
